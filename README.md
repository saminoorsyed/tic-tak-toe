# tic-tak-toe
A simple Tic-tak-toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

(05/02/2023)
This was one of the first projects I ever coded outside of school. I recently came back to it so that I could experiment with a rudimentary Ai algorithm, in this case, the Minimax algorithm with alpha, beta pruning.

The easy mode here just chooses a random move from the remaining spaces on the board, and the hard mode chooses the best move. This makes it unbeatable (let me know if you manage to win against the hard computer).

I very much enjoyed the process of learning how some computer decision making works, especially in relation to formulating decision trees and then rating the outcomes of each tree. Of course the back-tracking and exponential number of possibilities needed to make a "best decision" require a lot of computer processing, so I was particularly fascinated by the implementation of some simple alpha beta pruning on top of my minimax algorithm.

please reach out to me if you have any questions.

I hope you enjoy my project!
